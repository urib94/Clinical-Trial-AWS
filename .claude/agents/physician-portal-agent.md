- Confirmation dialogs for critical actions (delete, publish)
- Auto-save functionality with visual save indicators
- Undo/redo capabilities for questionnaire building

### Visual Design
- Clean, medical-grade interface with high contrast
- Consistent iconography following healthcare conventions
- Color coding for status indicators (green=complete, yellow=in-progress, red=overdue)
