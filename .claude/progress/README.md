# Progress Tracking System

## Overview
This directory contains the progress tracking system for the Clinical Trial Platform development. The orchestration agent uses these files to maintain project state across multiple conversations and coordinate development activities.

## Files Structure

### Core Tracking Files
- **`project-state.json`** - Current project status, phase progress, and agent activity
- **`task-templates.json`** - Standardized task definitions for each development area
- **`orchestration-workflows.json`** - Workflow templates for common orchestration activities

### Progress Tracking Features

#### Project State Management
The project state tracks:
- Current development phase and overall progress
- Individual agent status (active, standby, blocked)
- Completed, in-progress, and pending tasks
- Quality gate status and milestone progress
- Budget and timeline adherence

#### Task Allocation System
Standardized task templates include:
- Clear deliverable specifications
- Acceptance criteria and quality standards
- Agent assignments (primary and supporting)
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- MCP tool requirements

#### Cross-Session Continuity
The Memory MCP server integration enables:
- Seamless project resumption across conversations
- Context preservation for all agents
- Historical decision tracking
- Learning from previous development patterns

## Orchestration Commands

### Basic Commands
- `@orchestrate status` - Generate current project status report
- `@orchestrate resume` - Continue from previous session state
- `@orchestrate allocate <task> to <agent>` - Assign specific work
- `@orchestrate review <deliverable>` - Quality review of completed work

### Progress Management
- `@orchestrate milestone <name>` - Mark milestone completion
- `@orchestrate block <task> <reason>` - Record blocker
- `@orchestrate unblock <task>` - Clear resolved blocker
- `@orchestrate handoff <from-agent> to <to-agent>` - Coordinate transitions

### Quality Control
- `@orchestrate validate <component>` - Comprehensive quality check
- `@orchestrate test <feature>` - Coordinate testing activities
- `@orchestrate deploy <environment>` - Oversee deployment process

## Usage Examples

### Starting a New Development Session
```
@orchestrate resume
```
This command loads the previous project state and identifies the next priority tasks.

### Allocating Architecture Work
```
@orchestrate allocate "AWS Architecture Diagram" to "System Architect"
```
This assigns the architecture diagram task with full context and deliverable specifications.

### Tracking Progress
```
@orchestrate status
```
Generates a comprehensive progress report showing phase completion, active work, and any blockers.

### Managing Quality Gates
```
@orchestrate validate "Database Schema"
```
Initiates a comprehensive review of the database schema against acceptance criteria.

## Integration with MCP Tools

### Memory MCP Server
- Stores project state persistently across sessions
- Remembers architectural decisions and rationale
- Maintains agent performance and preference data
- Tracks user feedback and satisfaction metrics

### GitHub MCP Server
- Synchronizes with repository milestones and issues
- Monitors CI/CD pipeline status
- Tracks pull request progress and reviews
- Generates reports from repository activity

### AWS MCP Server
- Monitors infrastructure deployment status
- Tracks resource utilization and costs
- Validates security configurations
- Oversees application health metrics

## Quality Gates by Phase

### Phase 1: Architecture & Setup
- Architecture review and AWS best practices compliance
- Security review for HIPAA alignment
- Cost validation against ≤$40/month target
- Technology stack approval

### Phase 2: Backend Development
- Database schema review and security validation
- API endpoint testing and documentation review
- Authentication system validation
- Performance benchmarking

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Mobile responsiveness validation
- PWA functionality testing
- User experience review

### Phase 4: Deployment & Finalization
- Security audit and penetration testing
- Performance testing under load
- Documentation completeness review
- Production readiness validation

## Metrics and KPIs

### Development Velocity
- Tasks completed per week
- Average hours per task
- Completion rate vs. estimates
- Blocker resolution time

### Quality Metrics
- Defect rate and resolution time
- Test coverage percentage
- Security scan pass rate
- Accessibility compliance score

### Project Health
- Budget adherence (≤$40/month target)
- Timeline progress vs. milestones
- Risk mitigation effectiveness
- Stakeholder satisfaction

## Best Practices

### Task Allocation
1. Always provide full context and acceptance criteria
2. Identify dependencies before assignment
3. Specify required MCP tools and resources
4. Set clear timeline expectations

### Progress Tracking
1. Update project state after each major completion
2. Record blockers immediately when identified
3. Maintain quality gate status consistently
4. Generate regular progress reports

### Quality Management
1. Review all deliverables against acceptance criteria
2. Ensure security and compliance validation
3. Validate performance and accessibility requirements
4. Document decisions and rationale

This progress tracking system enables efficient, coordinated development across multiple conversation sessions while maintaining high quality standards and project visibility.
